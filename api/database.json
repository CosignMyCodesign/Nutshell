      "synopsis": "Those who didn't know how impactful the rookie linebacker had been for the Dallas Cowboys this season got an eye-full when the bright lights of Sunday Night Football came on, facing the Philadelphia Eagles in a must-win scenario without All-Pro linebacker Sean Lee in tow. It's the fourth game Lee has missed this season with nagging hamstring injuries, and it won't be his last, his absence predicted to stretch upwards of six weeks. If that holds firm, he'll end up having been sidelined nine of 16 regular season games, a keen reminder of why the Cowboys selected Vander Esch with the 19th-overall pick in the first place.",

While its Amazon haul pales in comparison to the 25,000 jobs bound for each of New York and Arlington, Virginia, its presence could affect life in Nashville almost as much on a relative basis.",

The games seem meant to introduce a new generation of players to Pokémon, especially players who started with Pokémon Go. The changes made to gameplay may frustrate longtime fans, including me; I started playing in the late ‘90s and kept up with the franchise since. But I can’t bring myself to dislike Let’s Go! Eevee. Despite the changes and the modern Pokémon Go-influenced touches, the magic of Pokémon persists in Let’s Go, just by virtue of it being Pokémon.",
